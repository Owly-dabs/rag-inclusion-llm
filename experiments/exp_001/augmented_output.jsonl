This can lead to confusion and inefficiencies in debugging, as developers may not immediately recognize which parameter or value is causing the serialization problem.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo improve the error handling, the `_validate_json` method should be updated to provide a more descriptive error message. Instead of the generic message, the error message should include details about the specific parameter or value that is not JSON serializable.

For example, the error message could be changed to: `f\"Value '{value}' is not JSON-compatible\"`.

The current implementation raises a generic error message, \"Value is not JSON-compatible,\" when parameter defaults are not JSON serializable. This message lacks specificity and can lead to confusion for developers trying to debug the issue. A change is necessary to provide a more descriptive error message that offers context about why the parameter is not JSON serializable, thus improving the developer experience by making it easier to identify and resolve the problem.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo address this issue, the `_validate_json` method should be updated to provide a more informative error message. Instead of the generic \"Value is not JSON-compatible,\" the error message should include details about the specific parameter that failed serialization and potentially suggest what types of values are acceptable. This can be achieved by modifying the `ValidationError` to include the name of the parameter and a brief explanation of JSON serialization requirements. Additionally, it may be beneficial to review other parts of the codebase where similar error handling occurs to ensure consistency in error messaging across the platform.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\nWhen implementing error messages, it is a best practice to provide as much context as possible without overwhelming the user. This includes specifying which part of the input caused the error and offering guidance on how to correct it. Furthermore, maintaining consistency in error messaging throughout the codebase helps in creating a cohesive user experience. It may also be useful to document common serialization issues and solutions in the Prefect documentation to further aid developers."}]}

The problem arises because Javassist defaults to using the thread context classloader to load classes, which scalatest modifies to be a child URLClassLoader. This setup causes the `Class.forName()` method to fail in finding the necessary Icer class, as it searches in the parent classloader instead of the child. This discrepancy leads to class loading failures, particularly when dynamically loading Icer classes after they have been manipulated by Javassist, causing failures in the Mahout scalatest suite.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo address this issue, the code should be modified to explicitly set the classloader used by Javassist to the current classloader, rather than relying on the thread context classloader. This can be achieved by passing the appropriate classloader to the `CtClass.toClass()` method. Specifically, the code should be updated to ensure that when `icer_cc.toClass()` is called, it uses the classloader that has full visibility of the necessary classes, including the Icer classes. This change will likely involve updates in other parts of the codebase to ensure consistent classloader usage across different components interacting with Javassist.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\nThis change aligns with best practices in Java environments where multiple classloaders are present, as it helps avoid subtle bugs related to class loading.

This can be achieved by passing the appropriate classloader to the `CtClass.toClass()` method. Specifically, the change should involve obtaining the current classloader (typically the parent classloader in the hierarchy) and passing it to the `toClass()` method to ensure that the manipulated classes are accessible within the correct classloader space.
