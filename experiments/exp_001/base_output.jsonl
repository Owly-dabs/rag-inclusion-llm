This restriction limited the flexibility of the plotting function, causing a `ValueError` when the number of images did not align with the specified rows and columns. The current code attempts to plot images in a grid layout, but the calculation of the number of columns (`len(ims)//rows`) can lead to incorrect or unintended layouts, especially when the number of images does not divide evenly by the number of rows.

The current implementation raises a generic `ValidationError` with the message \"Value is not JSON-compatible\" when a parameter default is not JSON serializable. This message lacks specificity and does not provide developers with enough context to easily identify and resolve the issue. Improving this error message is necessary to enhance the developer experience by making it more informative and actionable, thereby reducing confusion and streamlining the debugging process.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Enhance the Error Message**: Modify the `ValidationError` message in the `_validate_json` method to include more specific information about the value that caused the error and possibly suggest a solution. For example, the error message could be updated to: `\"The parameter default value '{value}' is not JSON-compatible. Ensure all default values are JSON serializable.\"` This provides more context and guidance to the developer.\n\n2. **Include Parameter Name**: If possible, include the name of the parameter that caused the error in the message. This would require passing additional context to the `_validate_json` method, such as the parameter name, which might involve changes in how this method is called.\n\n3. **Logging**: Consider adding logging for these validation errors to help with debugging and monitoring. This can be done by integrating a logging framework to capture these events with more detail.\n\n4. **Documentation Update**: Ensure that the documentation reflects these changes, providing examples of common non-JSON serializable types and how to handle them.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Best Practices**: Providing detailed error messages is a best practice in software development as it aids in debugging and improves user experience.

This might involve creating a centralized error handling utility to manage such messages uniformly across the application.\n- **Testing**: Ensure that unit tests are updated or added to cover these changes, verifying that the new error messages are correctly triggered and displayed."}]}

Specifically, the problem occurs because Javassist, a bytecode manipulation library, defaults to using the thread context classloader to load classes.

This results in the `Class.forName()` method failing to locate the necessary Icer class, as it searches in the parent classloader rather than the child classloader where the class is actually loaded. This discrepancy causes failures in the Mahout scalatest suite, as the manipulated classes are not found during testing.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo address this issue, the code should be modified to explicitly specify the classloader used by Javassist when loading classes. Instead of relying on the thread context classloader, which is altered by scalatest, the code should use the current classloader that has full visibility of the necessary classes.

This restriction limits the flexibility of the plotting functionality, as users may want to plot a number of images that do not fit neatly into a grid with the specified number of rows. The change is necessary to allow for more versatile plotting of images, accommodating scenarios where the number of images does not conform to a strict grid layout.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo address this issue, the `plots_raw` function should be modified to handle cases where the number of images is not evenly divisible by the number of rows. This can be achieved by calculating the number of columns dynamically based on the number of images and rows, and ensuring that the subplot grid can accommodate all images without raising an error. Here is a suggested modification:\n\n```python\ndef plots_raw(ims, figsize=(12,6), rows=1, titles=None):\n    f = plt.figure(figsize=figsize)\n    cols = (len(ims) + rows - 1) // rows  # Calculate the number of columns needed\n    for i in range(len(ims)):\n        sp = f.add_subplot(rows, cols, i+1)\n        sp.axis('Off')\n        if titles is not None: sp.set_title(titles[i], fontsize=16)\n        plt.imshow(ims[i])\n```\n\nThis change calculates the number of columns (`cols`) required to fit all images by using integer division and rounding up, ensuring that all images can be plotted without error. This approach provides the necessary flexibility for users to plot images in a grid layout that best suits their needs.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\nWhen implementing this change, it is important to consider the overall user experience and ensure that the plotting functionality remains intuitive. Additionally, testing should be conducted to verify that the modified function behaves as expected across various scenarios, including edge cases where the number of images is less than the number of rows or when there are no images to plot. This change aligns with best practices for creating flexible and user-friendly software features, enhancing the usability of the image plotting functionality."}]}

The current implementation raises a generic error message, \"Value is not JSON-compatible,\" when a flow is registered with default parameters that cannot be serialized into JSON. This message lacks specificity and does not provide developers with enough context to easily identify and resolve the issue. A more descriptive error message is necessary to improve the developer experience by clearly indicating which parameter is causing the problem and why it is not JSON serializable.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Enhance Error Message**: Modify the `_validate_json` method to include more detailed information in the error message. Instead of simply stating that a value is not JSON-compatible, the error message should specify which parameter is causing the issue and provide hints on how to resolve it. For example, the error message could include the parameter name and suggest checking for non-serializable types like functions, classes, or complex objects.\n\n   ```python\n   def _validate_json(self, value: Any, param_name: str = \"\") -> None:\n       try:\n           json.dumps(value)\n       except TypeError as type_error:\n           raise ValidationError(\n               f\"Parameter '{param_name}' with value '{value}' is not JSON-compatible. \"\n               \"Ensure all default parameters are JSON serializable (e.g., avoid using functions, classes, or complex objects).\"\n           ) from type_error\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Method Calls**: Ensure that the `_validate_json` method is called with the appropriate parameter name wherever it is used in the codebase. This might involve updating the method signature and calls to pass the parameter name.\n\n   ```python\n   def _serialize(self, value, attr, obj, **kwargs):  # type: ignore\n       self._validate_json(value, attr)\n       return super()._serialize(value, attr, obj, **kwargs)\n   ```\n\n3. **Documentation and Comments**: Update any relevant documentation or inline comments to reflect the changes in error handling. This will help maintain clarity for future developers working with the code.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Best Practices**: Providing clear and actionable error messages is a best practice in software development. It enhances the user experience by reducing the time spent debugging and allows developers to quickly understand and fix issues.\n- **Broader Architectural Concerns**: Consider implementing a logging mechanism that captures these errors for further analysis. This can help identify common serialization issues and guide future improvements.\n- **Testing**: Ensure that unit tests are updated or added to verify the new error messages and validate that the changes do not introduce regressions."}]}
