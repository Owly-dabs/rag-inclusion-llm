### Explanation
To address the issue of enforcing the use of the `open3d::benchmarks` namespace in benchmarks, several code changes need to be made. These changes are necessary to standardize the namespace usage across the codebase, which helps maintain consistency, enhances code readability, and prevents naming conflicts. Here's a detailed explanation of the changes required:

1. **Namespace Declaration**: Ensure that all benchmark-related functionalities are encapsulated within the `open3d::benchmarks` namespace. This involves adding the appropriate namespace declarations in the relevant files. For example, in files like `cpp/benchmarks/geometry/KDTreeFlann.cpp`, `cpp/benchmarks/geometry/SamplePoints.cpp`, and others, the namespace should be declared as follows:

   ```cpp
   namespace open3d {
   namespace benchmarks {
   ```

   This ensures that all the functions and classes related to benchmarks are grouped under this namespace.

2. **Namespace Usage**: Update the existing code to prepend the `open3d::benchmarks` namespace where necessary. This involves modifying function definitions, class declarations, and any other relevant code elements to include the namespace. For instance, if a function is defined as `void SomeFunction()`, it should be updated to `void open3d::benchmarks::SomeFunction()`.

3. **Include Statements**: Ensure that include statements are updated to reflect the new namespace organization. This might involve changing paths in include statements to align with the new namespace structure. For example, if a file includes `#include "benchmarks/Benchmarks.h"`, ensure that the path is correct and reflects the new namespace organization.

4. **Code Reorganization**: Reorganize the code files to reflect the namespace structure. This might involve moving files into directories that correspond to the namespace hierarchy. For example, files related to benchmarks should be placed in a directory structure that mirrors the `open3d::benchmarks` namespace.

5. **Update Documentation**: Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file to document the changes made. This is important for maintaining clear and detailed documentation of modifications made to the codebase. The changelog should include information about the namespace standardization and any other relevant changes.

### Explanation
To address the issue described and implement the necessary changes for flexible image plotting, we need to modify the code in the `plots`, `plots_from_files`, and `plots_raw` functions within the `fastai/plots.py` file. The goal is to remove the restriction that causes a `ValueError` when the number of images doesn't fit into a predefined grid of rows and columns. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the changes needed:

### Code Changes

1. **Remove Fixed Grid Restriction**:
   - The current implementation calculates the number of columns as `len(ims)//rows`, which assumes that the number of images (`len(ims)`) is perfectly divisible by the number of rows (`rows`). This can lead to a `ValueError` if the division is not exact.
   - To fix this, we should calculate the number of columns dynamically based on the total number of images and the specified number of rows. This can be done using the `ceil` function from the `math` module to ensure that all images are accommodated.

2. **Import Required Module**:
   - Import the `ceil` function from the `math` module to calculate the number of columns.

3. **Update Subplot Calculation**:
   - Modify the subplot calculation to use the `ceil` function for determining the number of columns. This ensures that the grid can accommodate all images even if the number of images is not perfectly divisible by the number of rows.

### Example Code Changes

Here is how the code changes would look:

```python
# Import the ceil function from the math module
from math import ceil

def plots(ims, figsize=(12,6), rows=1, interp=False, titles=None, maintitle=None):
    if type(ims[0]) is np.ndarray:
        ims = np.array(ims)
        if (ims.shape[-1] != 3): ims = ims.transpose((0,2,3,1))
    f = plt.figure(figsize=figsize)
    if maintitle is not None:
        plt.suptitle(maintitle, fontsize=16)
    # Calculate the number of columns using ceil
    cols = ceil(len(ims) / rows)
    for i in range(len(ims)):
        sp = f.add_subplot(rows, cols, i+1)
        sp.axis('Off')
        if titles is not None: sp.set_title(titles[i], fontsize=16)
        plt.imshow(ims[i], interpolation=None if interp else 'none')

def plots_from_files(imspaths, figsize=(10,5), rows=1, titles=None, maintitle=None):
    f = plt.figure(figsize=figsize)
    if maintitle is not None: plt.suptitle(maintitle, fontsize=16)
    # Calculate the number of columns using ceil
    cols = ceil(len(imspaths) / rows)
    for i in range(len(imspaths)):
        sp = f.add_subplot(rows, cols, i+1)
        sp.axis('Off')
        if titles is not None: sp.set_title(titles[i], fontsize=16)
        img = plt.imread(imspaths[i])
        plt.imshow(img)

def plots_raw(ims, figsize=(12,6), rows=1, titles=None):
    f = plt.figure(figsize=figsize)
    # Calculate the number of columns using ceil
    cols = ceil(len(ims) / rows)
    for i in range(len(ims)):
        sp = f.add_subplot(rows, cols, i+1)
        sp.axis('Off')
        if titles is not None: sp.set_title(titles[i], fontsize=16)
        plt.imshow(ims[i])
```

### Explanation

- **Dynamic Column Calculation**: By using `ceil(len(ims) / rows)`, we ensure that the number of columns is sufficient to display all images, even if the number of images is not perfectly divisible by the number of rows.
- **Flexibility**: This change allows users to specify any number of rows, and the function will automatically adjust the number of columns to fit all images, enhancing the flexibility and usability of the plotting functionality.
- **Error Prevention**: By removing the fixed grid restriction, we prevent the `ValueError` that occurred when the number of images didn't fit into the predefined grid, improving the user experience.

To address the issue described, the code changes need to focus on preventing the selection of disabled options within the `Select` class in JavaScript. Here's a detailed explanation of the necessary modifications and the rationale behind them:

### Code Changes

1. **Identify Disabled Options:**
   - Modify the existing logic within the `Select` class to identify options that are disabled. This can be done by checking the `disabled` attribute of each option element.

2. **Prevent Selection of Disabled Options:**
   - Before allowing an option to be selected (i.e., before calling `option.click()`), add a condition to check if the option is disabled. If the option is disabled, skip the selection process for that option.

3. **Update the Constructor or Relevant Methods:**
   - Ensure that the constructor or relevant methods that handle option selection incorporate the logic to check for the `disabled` attribute. This might involve updating methods that iterate over options to include this check.

### Example Code Snippet

Here's a conceptual example of how the code might be modified:

```javascript
for (let option of options) {
  // Check if the option is disabled
  const isDisabled = await option.getAttribute('disabled');
  
  // Only proceed if the option is not disabled
  if (!isDisabled) {
    if (!(await option.isSelected())) {
      await option.click();
    }
  }
}
```

### Rationale for the Changes

1. **User Experience:**

## Repository: ipython/ipython#8930
### Explanation
To address the issue of a `ResourceWarning` related to not closing `devnull` at exit in Python 3, you need to make some changes to the code. The goal is to ensure that the `devnull` file descriptor is properly closed when the program exits, which will help in managing system resources effectively and prevent any warnings.

### Code Changes Needed:

1. **Ensure Proper Closure of `devnull`:**
   - Modify the code to ensure that the `devnull` file descriptor is closed when the program exits. This can be done by using a context manager or by explicitly closing it in a cleanup function.

2. **Use a Context Manager:**
   - One way to handle this is by using a context manager to automatically close the file when it is no longer needed. This can be done by wrapping the `open` call in a `with` statement.

3. **Explicitly Close `devnull`:**
   - If you prefer not to use a context manager, you can explicitly close `devnull` at the end of the program or in a cleanup function that is registered to run at exit.

### Example Code Changes:

Here is an example of how you might modify the code to ensure `devnull` is closed properly:

```python
import os
import atexit

# Open devnull and register a cleanup function to close it at exit
devnull = open(os.devnull, 'w')

def cleanup():
    devnull.close()

atexit.register(cleanup)

# setup stdin/stdout/stderr to sys.stdin/sys.stdout/sys.stderr
stdin = IOStream(sys.stdin, fallback=devnull)
stdout = IOStream(sys.stdout, fallback=devnull)
stderr = IOStream(sys.stderr, fallback=devnull)

class IOTerm:
    """ Term holds the file or file-like objects for handling I/O operations."""
```

### Explanation:

- **`atexit` Module:** The `atexit` module is used to register a cleanup function that will be called when the program is about to exit. This ensures that `devnull` is closed properly, preventing any `ResourceWarning`.
  
- **`cleanup` Function:** The `cleanup` function is defined to close the `devnull` file descriptor. It is registered with `atexit.register(cleanup)`, which ensures it is executed when the program terminates.

By implementing these changes, you ensure that the `devnull` file descriptor is properly closed, which helps in managing resources efficiently and prevents the `ResourceWarning` from occurring. This change is particularly important for maintaining the stability and reliability of Python programs, especially for users still utilizing the Python 3 branch.

### Code Changes Needed:

1. **Import the Required Function:**
   - Ensure that the `accuracy_score` function from the `sklearn.metrics` package is imported. This function will be used to calculate accuracy in a more robust manner.

2. **Modify the `simple_accuracy()` Function:**
   - Replace the existing line of code in the `simple_accuracy()` function that calculates accuracy using `(preds == labels).mean()` with the `accuracy_score(labels, preds)` function.

### Updated Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score  # Ensure this import is present

if _has_sklearn:

    def simple_accuracy(preds, labels):
        return accuracy_score(labels, preds)  # Updated line

    def acc_and_f1(preds, labels):
        acc = simple_accuracy(preds, labels)
        f1 = f1_score(y_true=labels, y_pred=preds)
        return {
            "acc": acc,
            # other metrics...
        }
```

### Why These Changes Are Necessary:

1. **Avoiding AttributeError:**
   - The original method `(preds == labels).mean()` can raise an `AttributeError` because the comparison operation results in a boolean array, and calling `.mean()` on it is not always valid. This can lead to errors in the code execution.

2. **Using a Robust Method:**
   - The `accuracy_score()` function from `sklearn.metrics` is specifically designed to calculate accuracy and handles various edge cases internally. It is a more robust and reliable method for this purpose.

        to customize the behavior of local scope retrieval.
        """
        # Default behavior: use frame locals
        return sys._getframe(stack_depth).f_locals

    def some_existing_method(self):
        # Existing code...
        if getattr(fn, "needs_local_scope", False):
            kwargs['local_ns'] = self.get_local_scope(stack_depth)
        # Continue with existing logic...

```

### Why These Changes Are Necessary:

### Explanation
To address the issue of failing screenshot tests in Microsoft Edge due to its unique behavior of capturing only the viewport, the following code changes need to be made:

1. **Identify the Failing Tests:**
   - First, identify the specific screenshot tests that are failing in the Edge browser. These tests are failing because Edge captures only the visible viewport in screenshots, unlike other browsers that capture the entire page.

2. **Modify the Test Suite:**
   - Update the test suite to include conditional logic that checks the browser type. If the tests are running in the Edge browser, the identified failing screenshot tests should be skipped or ignored.

3. **Implement Conditional Logic:**
   - Use a programming construct (such as an `if` statement or a test framework's built-in feature) to conditionally disable the tests for Edge. This can be done by checking the browser's user agent or using a configuration setting that specifies the browser type.

4. **Add Comments and Documentation:**
   - Clearly comment on the changes in the code to explain why these tests are being disabled for Edge. This will help future developers understand the reason behind the change and maintain the code effectively.

5. **Test the Changes:**
   - After making these changes, run the test suite across different browsers to ensure that the tests are correctly ignored in Edge and that the suite still functions as expected in other browsers.

6. **Update Documentation:**
   - If there is any documentation related to the test suite, update it to reflect the changes made. This includes noting that certain tests are disabled for Edge due to its screenshot behavior.

By implementing these changes, you ensure that the test suite remains reliable and accurate, preventing false negatives caused by Edge's distinct screenshot behavior. This approach maintains the integrity of the testing process while accommodating browser-specific differences.

### Explanation
The code changes described in the provided context aim to address two main issues within the Open3D project: a crash related to an abandoned FBX model and the prevention of duplicate object names. Here's a detailed explanation of the changes and the rationale behind them:

1. **Preventing Duplicate Object Names:**

   - **Current Code:**
     ```cpp
     std::vector<std::string> mesh_object_names;
     for (const auto& mesh : model.meshes_) {
         auto& mat = model.materials_[mesh.material_idx];
         std::string derived_name(object_name + ":" + mesh.mesh_name);
         AddGeometry(derived_name, *(mesh.mesh), mat);
         mesh_object_names.push_back(derived_name);
     }
     model_geometries_[object_name] = mesh_object_names;
     ```

   - **Updated Code:**
     ```cpp
     std::vector<std::string> mesh_object_names;
     std::unordered_set<std::string> check_duplicates;
     for (const auto& mesh : model.meshes_) {
         auto& mat = model.materials_[mesh.material_idx];
         std::string derived_name(object_name + ":" + mesh.mesh_name);
         while (check_duplicates.count(derived_name) > 0) {
             derived_name += "D";
         }
         check_duplicates.insert(derived_name);
         AddGeometry(derived_name, *(mesh.mesh), mat);
         mesh_object_names.push_back(derived_name);
     }
     model_geometries_[object_name] = mesh_object_names;
     ```

   - **Explanation:**
     The updated code introduces a mechanism to prevent duplicate object names by using an `std::unordered_set` called `check_duplicates`. When generating a `derived_name` for each mesh, the code checks if the name already exists in the set. If it does, it appends a "D" to the name until a unique name is found. This ensures that each object name is unique, preventing conflicts and potential errors during the rendering process.

2. **Fixing the Crash Related to Abandoned FBX Model:**

   - **General Approach:**
     While the specific code changes for fixing the crash related to the abandoned FBX model are not explicitly detailed in the provided context, the general approach would involve identifying the root cause of the crash and implementing a solution to handle it gracefully. This might include adding checks to ensure that resources related to the FBX model are properly managed and released, or implementing error handling to prevent the crash from occurring.

3. **Updating the CHANGELOG.md:**

   - **Importance:**
     Updating the `CHANGELOG.md` file is crucial for maintaining a transparent and organized record of changes made to the project. It helps contributors and users understand what changes have been made, the reasons behind them, and any potential impacts on the project. This practice is essential for effective project management and communication within the development community.
