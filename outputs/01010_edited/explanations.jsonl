For example:\n     ```python\n     import warnings\n\n     def clear(self, gui=None):\n         if gui is None:\n             self.apps = {}\n         elif gui in self.apps:\n             if gui in ['wx', 'qt4']:  # Assuming these are deprecated\n                 warnings.warn(f\"The '{gui}' toolkit is deprecated and will be removed in future releases.\", DeprecationWarning)\n             del self.apps[gui]\n\n     def register(self, toolkitname, *aliases):\n         if toolkitname in ['wx', 'qt4']:  # Assuming these are deprecated\n             warnings.warn(f\"Registering '{toolkitname}' is deprecated and will be removed in future releases.\", DeprecationWarning)\n         # Existing registration logic\n     ```\n\n2. **Update Documentation:**\n   - Ensure that the documentation reflects these deprecations, guiding developers on the preferred alternatives. This includes updating docstrings and any relevant documentation files.\n\n3. **Refactor for Clarity:**\n   - Consider refactoring the code to improve readability and maintainability. For example, using more descriptive variable names or breaking down complex logic into smaller, well-named functions.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Best Practices for Deprecation:**\n  - Follow a structured deprecation policy, such as NEP 29, which is already mentioned in the README. This ensures a consistent approach to phasing out old features.\n  - Provide clear migration paths for developers, including examples and documentation on how to transition to supported features.\n\n- **Broader Architectural Concerns:**\n  - Evaluate the entire codebase for other instances where deprecation warnings might be necessary.

Given the broader context of the project, which involves cleaning up the codebase and adding deprecation warnings, it is crucial to ensure that any deprecated or soon-to-be-deprecated features are clearly marked. This helps maintain the codebase's health and assists developers in transitioning away from outdated features.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Add Deprecation Warnings**: Introduce a deprecation warning for the use of `inputhook_gtk3` if it is planned to be deprecated. This can be done using Python's `warnings` module. For example:\n   ```python\n   import warnings\n   warnings.warn(\n       \"The use of inputhook_gtk3 is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\",\n       DeprecationWarning\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Documentation Update**: Ensure that the code is well-documented, indicating the purpose of setting the input hook and any future changes.

Disabled options should not be interactive, and this behavior should be enforced both in the component logic and verified through testing.\n- **Broader Architectural Concerns**: Consider reviewing the entire Select component implementation to ensure that it adheres to accessibility standards, such as ARIA roles and properties, which can help in managing the state of UI elements like disabled options.\n- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Given that the test is run across multiple browsers (Firefox and Chrome), ensure that any changes made are compatible with the browser-specific behaviors and quirks related to handling disabled elements."}]}

The code constructs a command to run a Java process using `subprocess.Popen`, which includes specifying the classpath and various JVM options. The issue here is that the code is tightly coupled with the file system structure and relies on hardcoded paths and assumptions about directory names (e.g., `h2o-py`). This can lead to maintenance challenges and potential errors if the directory structure changes. Additionally, the use of `subprocess.Popen` without proper error handling or resource management (e.g., ensuring the process is terminated and resources are released) can lead to resource leaks or unhandled exceptions.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Dynamic Path Resolution**: Instead of hardcoding the directory structure, use environment variables or configuration files to determine the path to `genmodel.jar`. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.\n   \n2. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for the subprocess call. Check the return code of the process and handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the Java command. This can be done by checking `p.returncode` and raising an exception or logging an error if it is non-zero.\n\n3. **Resource Management**: Use a context manager (`with` statement) for the subprocess to ensure that resources are properly managed and that the process is terminated correctly.

Similarly, `compare_frames_local` assumes that the data frames are non-empty and of the same size without checking these conditions beforehand. These issues necessitate changes to ensure robustness and efficiency.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Error Handling in `cumop`:**\n   - Add checks to ensure `items` is not empty and `colInd` is within the valid range of columns.\n   - Handle cases where `op` might not be a valid operation for the data type of `items`.\n\n   ```python\n   def cumop(items, op, colInd=0):\n       if not items or colInd >= items.shape[1]:\n           raise ValueError(\"Invalid input: items is empty or colInd is out of range.\")\n       res = [None] * len(items)\n       for index in range(len(items)):\n           try:\n               res[index] = op(res[index-1], items[index, colInd]) if index > 0 else items[index, colInd]\n           except Exception as e:\n               raise RuntimeError(f\"Error applying operation: {e}\")\n       return res\n   ```\n\n2. **Enhancements in `compare_frames_local`:**\n   - Add checks to ensure both frames are not empty before proceeding with the comparison.\n   - Consider using numpy or pandas for efficient element-wise comparison instead of nested loops, which can be slow for large data frames.\n\n   ```python\n   def compare_frames_local(f1, f2, prob=0.5, tol=1e-6):\n       if f1.nrow == 0 or f2.nrow == 0:\n           raise ValueError(\"One or both frames are empty.\")\n       if (f1.nrow != f2.nrow) or (f1.ncol != f2.ncol):\n           raise ValueError(\"The two frames are of different sizes.\")\n       \n       temp1 = f1.as_data_frame(use_pandas=True)\n       temp2 = f2.as_data_frame(use_pandas=True)\n       \n       # Use pandas for efficient comparison\n       differences = (temp1 - temp2).abs() > tol\n       if differences.any().any():\n           raise AssertionError(\"Frames differ beyond tolerance.\")\n   ```\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Error Handling Best Practices:** Always validate inputs and handle potential exceptions to prevent runtime errors and ensure the code is robust.\n- **Performance Optimization:** Utilize libraries like numpy or pandas for data manipulation tasks, as they are optimized for performance and can handle large datasets more efficiently than native Python loops.\n- **Code Readability:** Clear error messages and structured code improve maintainability and help in debugging issues quickly."}, {"filename": "h2o-py/tests/pyunit_utils/utilsPY.py", "code": "    print(\"Downloading Java prediction model code from H2O\")\n    TMPDIR = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath('__file__')), \"..\", \"results\", MOJONAME))\n    os.makedirs(TMPDIR)\n    model.download_mojo(path=TMPDIR)    # save mojo\n    return model\n\n\n# generate random dataset, copied from Pasha\ndef random_dataset(response_type, verbose=True, NTESTROWS=200):\n    \"\"\"Create and return a random dataset.\"\"\"\n    if verbose: print(\"\\nCreating a dataset for a %s problem:\" % response_type)\n    fractions = {k + \"_fraction\": random.random() for k in \"real categorical integer time string binary\".split()}", "explanation": "## Explanation of the issue:\nThe provided code snippet is part of a process that downloads a MOJO model from H2O and saves it to a specified directory.

This could involve capturing the command's output and exit status, and handling any errors appropriately.\n   ```r\n   result <- system(cmd, intern = TRUE, ignore.stderr = FALSE)\n   if (attr(result, \"status\") != 0) {\n       stop(\"MOJO prediction command failed: \", paste(result, collapse = \"\\n\"))\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Improved CSV Import:**\n   - Ensure that the CSV import process is robust by checking if the file exists before attempting to import it. Additionally, handle any potential errors during the import process.\n   ```r\n   csv_file_path <- paste(tmpdir_name, \"out_mojo.csv\", sep = '/')\n   if (!file.exists(csv_file_path)) {\n       stop(\"Prediction output file does not exist: \", csv_file_path)\n   }\n   predictions2 <- tryCatch({\n       h2o.importFile(csv_file_path, header = TRUE)\n   }, error = function(e) {\n       stop(\"Failed to import prediction results: \", e$message)\n   })\n   ```\n\n3. **Code Clarity and Maintainability:**\n   - Consider refactoring the code to improve readability and maintainability. For example, using descriptive variable names and breaking down complex expressions into simpler parts can enhance understanding.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Security Considerations:** When executing system commands, always validate and sanitize inputs to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.\n- **Error Handling Best Practices:** Use structured error handling (e.g., `tryCatch` in R) to manage potential failures gracefully and provide informative error messages to users.\n- **Code Readability:** Adopting consistent naming conventions and code formatting can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of the codebase.\n- **Testing:** Ensure that comprehensive tests are in place to verify the functionality of the changes, especially when dealing with external system calls and file operations."}]}

This problem is critical as it affects the reliability of integration tests that depend on the ability to delete tables, which is a fundamental operation in managing DynamoDB resources. The provided code snippet shows a function `delete_table` that attempts to delete a DynamoDB table using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). However, the problem might not be directly in this code snippet but rather in the configuration or initialization of LocalStack or the handling of exceptions and retries in the code.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Exception Handling and Logging**: Enhance the `delete_table` function to include comprehensive exception handling and logging. This will help in diagnosing issues when the delete operation fails. For example:\n   ```python\n   import logging\n\n   def delete_table(name):\n       dynamodb_client = aws_stack.connect_to_service('dynamodb')\n       try:\n           dynamodb_client.delete_table(TableName=name)\n           logging.info(f\"Table {name} deleted successfully.\")\n       except dynamodb_client.exceptions.ResourceInUseException as e:\n           logging.error(f\"Failed to delete table {name}: {str(e)}\")\n       except Exception as e:\n           logging.error(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Retry Logic**: Implement a retry mechanism to handle transient errors that might occur due to timing issues or temporary unavailability of the service. This can be done using a library like `tenacity`:\n   ```python\n   from tenacity import retry, wait_fixed, stop_after_attempt\n\n   @retry(wait=wait_fixed(2), stop=stop_after_attempt(3))\n   def delete_table(name):\n       # Existing code with exception handling\n   ```\n\n3. **Configuration Check**: Ensure that LocalStack is correctly configured to run the DynamoDB service independently. This might involve checking the LocalStack setup scripts or configuration files to ensure that all necessary dependencies and initializations are correctly handled.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Best Practices**: It is a best practice to include logging and exception handling in operations that interact with external services, such as AWS, to facilitate debugging and improve resilience.\n- **Broader Architectural Concerns**: If the issue persists, it may be necessary to review the broader architecture of the test environment setup, particularly how LocalStack is initialized and how services are started. Ensuring that all dependencies are correctly managed and that services are started in the correct order can prevent such issues.\n- **Testing**: After implementing the changes, it is crucial to run the integration tests again to verify that the issue has been resolved and that the delete operation works as expected under the specified conditions."}]}

The provided code snippet is part of a function that interacts with option elements within a select tag.

This oversight can lead to a poor user experience, as users might inadvertently interact with options that should be inactive, thereby violating the intended functionality of the interface.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo address this issue, the code should be modified to include a check for the disabled state of an option before attempting to select it.

This not only improves the user experience but also adheres to best practices in web development, where disabled elements should be non-interactive.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo address this issue, the code should be modified to include a check for disabled options within the `Select` class. Specifically, when an option is being selected, the code should verify whether the option is disabled and prevent its selection if it is. This can be achieved by adding a condition in the constructor or the method responsible for handling option selection. For example:\n\n```javascript\nclass Select {\n  constructor(options) {\n    this.options = options;\n  }\n\n  selectOption(value) {\n    const matched = this.options.find(option => option.value === value);\n\n    if (!matched) {\n      throw new Error(`Cannot locate option with value: ${value}`);\n    }\n\n    if (matched.disabled) {\n      throw new Error(`Cannot select a disabled option with value: ${value}`);\n    }\n\n    // Proceed with selecting the option\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `selectOption` method checks if the matched option is disabled before allowing it to be selected. If the option is disabled, an error is thrown, preventing the selection.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\nImplementing this change aligns with the principle of least astonishment, ensuring that the application behaves in a way that users intuitively expect. Additionally, this change may require updates in other parts of the codebase where options are defined or manipulated, ensuring that the `disabled` property is correctly set and respected throughout the application. It is also important to consider unit tests to verify that disabled options cannot be selected, maintaining the robustness of the codebase."}]}

The problem arises because `devnull` is not being closed properly at program exit, leading to a `ResourceWarning`. This warning indicates that a resource (in this case, a file descriptor) was not released, which can lead to resource leaks and potentially degrade performance or cause unexpected behavior in applications. The code snippet provided does not directly show the handling of `devnull`, but it is part of a larger codebase where such a fix would be relevant. Addressing this issue is important for ensuring efficient resource management and maintaining the stability of applications running on Python 3.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Ensure Proper Closure of `devnull`:** \n   - Identify where `devnull` is being used in the codebase. This might involve searching for instances where `os.devnull` is opened.\n   - Use a context manager to ensure that `devnull` is closed properly.

This is particularly important in long-running applications or those that open many file descriptors, as it can degrade performance or lead to unexpected behavior. Proper resource management is crucial to ensure that file descriptors are closed when they are no longer needed, preventing potential resource exhaustion.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo address the issue, the code should be modified to ensure that `devnull` is properly closed when it is no longer needed.

This approach can lead to an `AttributeError` because the comparison `(preds == labels)` results in a boolean array, and calling `.mean()` on a boolean object is not valid. This can cause the code to break, especially if the boolean array is not automatically converted to a numerical array that supports the `.mean()` method. Therefore, a change is necessary to ensure that the accuracy calculation is robust and does not raise exceptions.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo address this issue, the `simple_accuracy()` method should be updated to use the `accuracy_score()` function from the `sklearn.metrics` package. This function is specifically designed to calculate accuracy and handles the comparison of predictions and labels correctly without raising exceptions. The updated code should look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\nif _has_sklearn:\n\n    def simple_accuracy(preds, labels):\n        return accuracy_score(labels, preds)\n\n    def acc_and_f1(preds, labels):\n        acc = simple_accuracy(preds, labels)\n        f1 = f1_score(y_true=labels, y_pred=preds)\n        return {\n            \"acc\": acc,\n```\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\nUsing `accuracy_score()` from `sklearn.metrics` is a best practice because it is a well-tested and widely used function that ensures accurate and efficient calculation of accuracy. Additionally, this change may require ensuring that `sklearn` is included as a dependency in the project, if it is not already. It is also advisable to review other parts of the codebase where accuracy calculations are performed to ensure consistency and robustness across the entire application."}]}

This is particularly problematic in instances with a large number of tables. The current implementation does not efficiently handle schema loading, leading to performance bottlenecks. The use of `information_schema` is suggested as a means to optimize this process, as it can provide metadata about the database schema more efficiently than querying each table individually.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Utilize `information_schema` for Schema Loading**: Modify the `run_query` method to incorporate queries that leverage `information_schema` to retrieve schema details. This can significantly reduce the number of queries and the amount of data processed, thereby improving performance.\n\n2. **Implement Pagination or Batching**: If `information_schema` queries still result in large datasets, consider implementing pagination or batching to handle the data in smaller, more manageable chunks. This can prevent timeouts and reduce memory usage.\n\n3. **Optimize Connection Handling**: Ensure that the connection to the Presto instance is efficiently managed. This includes reusing connections where possible and ensuring that connections are properly closed after use to prevent resource leaks.\n\n4. **Error Handling and Logging**: Enhance error handling to provide more informative logs in case of failures.

The macro `DISPATCH_DTYPE_TO_TEMPLATE` is designed to execute a lambda function with a type-specific alias (`scalar_t`) based on the provided `DTYPE`. However, the use of macros for type dispatching can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code, especially when nested macros are involved. This complexity can hinder readability and debugging, and it may not leverage modern C++ features effectively. The issue arises from the need to improve compilation speed and avoid nested template macro generation, which can be achieved by refactoring the code to use more modern C++ techniques.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Replace Macros with Template Functions**: Instead of using macros, consider using template functions or template specialization. This approach is more type-safe and easier to debug. For example, create a template function that takes a function object and a type, and then specialize it for each supported type.\n\n   ```cpp\n   template<typename Func>\n   void DispatchDtype(open3d::Dtype dtype, Func func) {\n       switch (dtype) {\n           case open3d::Dtype::Float32:\n               func.template operator()<float>();\n               break;\n           case open3d::Dtype::Float64:\n               func.template operator()<double>();\n               break;\n           case open3d::Dtype::Int32:\n               func.template operator()<int32_t>();\n               break;\n           case open3d::Dtype::Int64:\n               func.template operator()<int64_t>();\n               break;\n           case open3d::Dtype::UInt8:\n               func.template operator()<uint8_t>();\n               break;\n           default:\n               utility::LogError(\"Unsupported data type.\");\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Handle Boolean Separately**: For the boolean type, you can create a separate function or extend the existing function to handle it, ensuring that the logic remains clear and maintainable.\n\n   ```cpp\n   template<typename Func>\n   void DispatchDtypeWithBool(open3d::Dtype dtype, Func func) {\n       if (dtype == open3d::Dtype::Bool) {\n           func.template operator()<bool>();\n       } else {\n           DispatchDtype(dtype, func);\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Call Sites**: Ensure that all call sites of the macro are updated to use the new template functions. This may involve changes in other parts of the codebase where these macros are used.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Modern C++ Practices**: Using template functions instead of macros is a best practice in modern C++ as it enhances type safety, improves readability, and makes the code easier to maintain.\n- **Performance Considerations**: While templates can increase compile times due to code generation, they often result in more optimized runtime performance compared to macros.\n- **Documentation and Testing**: Ensure that the changes are well-documented and thoroughly tested to verify that the refactoring does not introduce any regressions.

The issue at hand is related to optimizing the compilation process by avoiding nested template macro generation. The current implementation uses templates to handle different data types for the `CPUNeqElementKernel` function, which can lead to increased compilation times due to the complexity and potential for nested template instantiation. This can slow down the build process, especially in large codebases where such patterns are prevalent. Therefore, a change is necessary to streamline the compilation process, improve efficiency, and maintain the codebase more effectively.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Template Specialization**: Consider using explicit template specialization for commonly used data types. This can reduce the overhead of template instantiation by providing specific implementations for frequently used types, thus minimizing the need for nested template generation.\n\n2. **Type Traits**: Utilize type traits to simplify type handling within the function. This can help in reducing the complexity of template logic and make the code more readable and maintainable.\n\n3. **Macro Reduction**: If macros are used elsewhere in the codebase to handle similar operations, consider refactoring them to use inline functions or constexpr functions where possible. This can help in reducing the complexity and improving the compilation speed.\n\n4. **Documentation and Comments**: Ensure that any changes made are well-documented within the code. This includes adding comments to explain the purpose of template specializations or any other optimizations applied.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Best Practices**: Follow C++ best practices for template programming, such as minimizing the use of macros, using inline functions, and leveraging modern C++ features like `constexpr` and `std::enable_if` for type checking and optimizations.\n- **Broader Architectural Concerns**: Consider the impact of these changes on the overall architecture of the codebase.

The issue at hand is related to the efficiency of the compilation process, specifically concerning the use of nested template macros. Nested template macros can lead to increased compilation times and complexity, making the code harder to maintain and understand. The goal is to optimize the build process by reducing or eliminating these nested templates, thereby improving compilation speed and overall code maintainability.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Refactor Nested Template Macros**: The current use of `DISPATCH_DTYPE_TO_TEMPLATE_WITH_BOOL` and `DISPATCH_DTYPE_TO_TEMPLATE` macros involves nested template dispatching. To improve this, consider refactoring the code to use a single level of template dispatching. This can be achieved by consolidating the logic for handling different data types and operations into a more streamlined structure, possibly using function overloading or template specialization.\n\n2. **Simplify Kernel Launching**: The switch-case structure used for launching different kernels based on the operation code (`op_code`) can be simplified. Consider using a mapping from operation codes to function pointers or lambda functions that encapsulate the kernel launching logic. This approach can reduce the complexity of the switch-case structure and make the code more modular.\n\n3. **Update Documentation and Changelog**: Ensure that any changes made to the code are reflected in the project's documentation and CHANGELOG.md file. This will help maintain transparency and provide a clear history of modifications for future reference.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Template Metaprogramming Best Practices**: When dealing with template metaprogramming, it's important to balance flexibility with complexity. Overuse of nested templates can lead to code that is difficult to read and maintain. Consider using modern C++ features such as `std::variant` or `std::visit` to handle type dispatching more elegantly.\n- **Code Maintainability**: Refactoring the code to reduce nested templates not only improves compilation speed but also enhances code readability and maintainability. This aligns with best practices in software engineering, where simplicity and clarity are prioritized.\n- **Broader Architectural Concerns**: While the focus is on the specific code snippet, it's important to consider how these changes might affect other parts of the codebase.

The current implementation uses nested template macros to dispatch data types and operations, which can lead to increased compilation times and complexity. This approach can be inefficient, especially when dealing with a large number of operations and data types, as it results in the generation of a significant amount of template code. This complexity can hinder maintainability and slow down the development process. Therefore, a change is necessary to optimize the compilation process by reducing the reliance on nested template macros.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Refactor Template Dispatching**: Instead of using nested template macros for dispatching data types, consider using a more streamlined approach such as type traits or a type-erased function pointer mechanism. This can reduce the number of template instantiations and simplify the code.\n\n2. **Consolidate Kernel Launch Logic**: The repeated pattern of launching CUDA kernels for different operations can be consolidated. Introduce a generic function that takes the operation as a parameter, reducing code duplication and improving readability.\n\n3. **Update the CHANGELOG.md**: Ensure that any changes made to the code are documented in the CHANGELOG.md file to maintain a clear record of modifications and improvements.\n\n4. **Improve Error Handling**: Add error handling for unsupported operations in the `default` case of the switch statement to ensure robustness.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Best Practices**: Consider using modern C++ features such as `std::variant` or `std::function` to manage different operations and data types more efficiently.\n- **Broader Architectural Concerns**: Evaluate the overall architecture for opportunities to modularize the code further, potentially separating the dispatch logic from the kernel execution logic to enhance maintainability.\n- **Performance Testing**: After implementing changes, conduct performance testing to ensure that the refactoring achieves the desired improvements in compilation speed and runtime efficiency."}]}

This redundancy is identified as unnecessary because the code responsible for this logging is unused, leading to inefficiencies in the system. The primary goal is to streamline the codebase by removing these unnecessary operations, thereby improving system performance and maintainability. The change involves commenting out the call to `flush_log()`, which is responsible for this redundant logging, thus optimizing resource utilization and reducing complexity.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo address the issue, the following changes should be made:\n\n1. **Comment Out Redundant Logging Call**: In the `worker.py` file, locate the call to `flush_log()` that logs to the primary Redis shard for every task. Comment out this line to disable the unnecessary logging operation. This will prevent the system from performing redundant tasks, thereby enhancing efficiency.\n\n2. **Code Review and Testing**: After making the change, conduct a thorough code review to ensure that no other parts of the codebase depend on this logging operation. Run comprehensive tests to validate that the system functions correctly without the logging, ensuring that the change does not introduce any unintended side effects.\n\n3. **Documentation Update**: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the change in logging behavior. This includes internal documentation for developers and any user-facing documentation that might reference logging operations.\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Best Practices**: Removing unused code aligns with best practices in software development, such as maintaining a clean and efficient codebase. This practice helps reduce technical debt and makes the system easier to understand and maintain.\n\n- **Broader Architectural Concerns**: Consider evaluating the overall logging strategy within the system. Ensure that logging operations are necessary, efficient, and provide value. This might involve assessing the logging framework and determining if further optimizations or changes are needed across the codebase.\n\n- **Performance Considerations**: By eliminating unnecessary logging, system resources such as CPU and memory are used more effectively, potentially leading to improved performance, especially in high-load scenarios where logging could become a bottleneck."}]}

The current code snippet shows various visualization options being defined within the `RenderOption` class, but it does not include an option for displaying wireframes. Adding this feature would enhance the flexibility and usability of the API, aligning it with user needs for more customizable 3D visualizations.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo address this issue, the following changes should be made:\n\n1. **Add a new member variable** to the `RenderOption` class to store the wireframe visibility state. This could be a boolean variable named `mesh_show_wireframe_`.\n\n2. **Expose the new option** in the Python API by adding a `def_readwrite` binding for `mesh_show_wireframe_`.

This discrepancy can lead to incorrect behavior when using IPython magic commands, such as `%timeit`, during debugging sessions. To address this, the extraction of the local scope should be refactored into a method, allowing subclasses to override and customize the behavior to suit different debugging environments.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Refactor Local Scope Extraction**: Move the logic for retrieving the local namespace into a dedicated method, such as `get_local_scope(stack_depth)`.
