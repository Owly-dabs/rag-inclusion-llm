This restriction led to a `ValueError` if the number of images did not fit within a predefined grid layout. The current code snippet shows a function `plots` that is responsible for plotting images. The function signature includes a `rows` parameter, but the code does not demonstrate how the number of rows is dynamically adjusted based on the number of images. This lack of flexibility in the code can lead to errors when the number of images does not align with the specified number of rows, thus necessitating a change to enhance usability and prevent errors.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Dynamic Row Calculation**: Modify the `plots` function to automatically calculate the number of rows based on the number of images and the desired grid layout. This can be achieved by dividing the total number of images by a fixed number of columns, or vice versa, to ensure that the images are plotted without errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to provide informative messages when the number of images cannot be evenly distributed across the specified rows and columns. This will help users understand the issue and adjust their input accordingly.\n\n3. **Flexible Grid Layout**: Introduce logic to handle cases where the number of images does not perfectly fit into the grid. This could involve leaving some grid spaces empty or adjusting the grid size dynamically.\n\n4. **Documentation Update**: Update the function's documentation to clearly explain how the number of rows and columns is determined and any constraints that may still exist.\n\nHere is a potential modification to the code:\n\n```python\ndef plots(ims, figsize=(12,6), rows=None, cols=None, interp=False, titles=None, maintitle=None):\n    n_images = len(ims)\n    if rows is None and cols is None:\n        cols = int(np.ceil(np.sqrt(n_images)))\n        rows = int(np.ceil(n_images / cols))\n    elif rows is None:\n        rows = int(np.ceil(n_images / cols))\n    elif cols is None:\n        cols = int(np.ceil(n_images / rows))\n    \n    if type(ims[0]) is np.ndarray:\n        ims = np.array(ims)\n        if (ims.shape[-1] != 3): ims = ims.transpose((0,2,3,1))\n    \n    f, axes = plt.subplots(rows, cols, figsize=figsize)\n    for i, ax in enumerate(axes.flat):\n        if i < n_images:\n            ax.imshow(ims[i], interpolation='none' if interp else 'bilinear')\n            if titles is not None:\n                ax.set_title(titles[i])\n        ax.axis('off')\n    if maintitle:\n        plt.suptitle(maintitle)\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.show()\n```\n\n### Supplementary notes (if any):\n- **Best Practices**: It is a good practice to allow functions to handle edge cases gracefully, such as when the number of items does not fit perfectly into a grid. This can be achieved by dynamically calculating layout parameters and providing clear error messages.\n- **User Experience**: Enhancing flexibility in plotting functions improves user experience by allowing users to focus on their data rather than on adjusting parameters to avoid errors.\n- **Code Readability**: Ensure that any changes maintain or improve the readability of the code.

Previously, the code imposed a restriction that could lead to a `ValueError` if the number of images did not fit neatly into a specified grid of rows and columns.

This can be achieved by replacing `len(ims)//rows` with a calculation that ensures all images are accommodated, such as `(len(ims) + rows - 1) // rows` to handle cases where the division is not exact.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Introduce error handling to manage scenarios where the number of images and rows specified might still lead to an awkward grid layout. This could involve checking if `rows` is greater than `len(ims)` and adjusting accordingly.\n\n3. **Documentation and Comments**: Add comments to the code to explain the logic behind the dynamic grid calculation and any assumptions made.

This approach lacks flexibility and can cause errors when the number of images does not match the grid dimensions, limiting the usability of the plotting functionality.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\nTo address this issue, the code should be modified to dynamically calculate the number of columns based on the total number of images and the specified number of rows. This can be achieved by using the `ceil` function from the `math` module to ensure that the number of columns is always rounded up to accommodate all images.

The current implementation raises a generic `ValidationError` with the message \"Value is not JSON-compatible\" when a value cannot be serialized to JSON.

A more descriptive error message is necessary to improve the developer experience by clearly indicating which parameter defaults are causing the serialization issue and why.\n\n### Suggested code changes:\n1. **Enhance the Error Message**: Modify the `_validate_json` method to include more detailed information in the error message. This could involve specifying the type of the value that failed serialization and potentially the attribute name or context in which the error occurred.

This may require changes in how `_serialize` or other parts of the codebase invoke `_validate_json`.\n\n3. **Update Documentation and Tests**: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new error message format.
